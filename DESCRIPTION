Title: Analyzes DIA-NN Data and Creates Several Useful Files
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Kyle Swovick
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This is meant for downstream analysis of DIA data searched with the 
  DIA-NN algorithm, primarily in a Univeristy core facility. This package will 
  filter the data, calculate protein abundance using the MaxLFQ algorithm, handle 
  missing values via imputation, create a series of plots meant for both 
  internal QC purposes and to  send to customers, and create a tsv containing
  protein-level information.
